## Overview
* We were tasked with making a page for the alumni association that is easy to understand and more modernized. Currently the association does not have a site to use and were accepting checks as the only form of payment and keeping tabs on everything by having a papertrail. We are here to create a mobile friendly app that is appealing to both the older and younger generation to keep everyone on the same page with upcoming events and registration.

## Tech Used 
React.js - UI
Firebase API - Login Mangement
GoogleMaps API
Bootstrap
